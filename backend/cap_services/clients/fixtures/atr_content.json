    "content": "In general, Conservative investors prefer knowing that their capital is safe rather than seeking higher returns. They are not particularly comfortable with the thought of investing in the stockmarket and would rather keep most of their money in lower risk assets.  However, Conservative investors do not believe that all of their money should be invested in lower risk assets such as Cash or Fixed Income.\r\nConservative investors typically have fairly limited knowledge of financial matters and they are unlikely to have much experience of investment.\r\nConservative investors can take a relatively long time to make up their mind on financial matters and will usually suffer from regret if their decisions turn out badly.\r\nRisk attitude is only one factor in determining a suitable investment strategy. You must also consider your ability to withstand short term losses, and your need to take risk to achieve your financial goals.",
    "extra_content": "There will inevitably be times when the value of your investments could drop quite sharply. You need to be aware and be comfortable that you have the necessary capacity for loss to accept this. For example, in a single bad year (i.e. in the bottom 5% of outcomes) your loss could be expected to be 5% or worse. You are prepared to take this level of risk as your retirement objectives are your highest priority.",

They tend to prefer lower risk assets, but realise riskier investments are likely to give better longer-term returns.  As a result, they realise that by taking a balanced level of risk the opportunity for increased returns is higher. \r\nBalanced investors typically have moderate levels of knowledge about financial matters and they may have some experience of investment in riskier assets.\r\nBalanced investors can take some time to make up their mind on financial matters and can suffer from regret when decisions turn out badly.\r\nRisk attitude is only one factor in determining a suitable investment strategy.
